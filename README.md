# castweb
In this folder are all webpages and scripts to use on a DVMEGA-Cast.
All tools are intended to update firmware on this unit.

For DVMEGA upload to be possible, you need to install pyserial 3.2.1
this way the scripts is able to access the serial port once it is freed up.

The nextion uploader script has been modified to suit the dvmega-cast, and is placed in the nextion-folder.
